# Supply Chain Service Reliability Analytics (FMCG)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes service reliability in an FMCG supply chain by tracking key fulfillment metrics such as On-Time (OT), In-Full (IF), and OTIF. The objective is to identify delivery gaps, operational inefficiencies, and customer service issues impacting business growth.

## 🧩 Business Problem
An FMCG company faced customer contract losses due to delayed and incomplete deliveries. Management required a data-driven solution to monitor daily service levels and take corrective actions before expanding into new markets.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Measure OT%, IF%, and OTIF% against defined targets  
- Identify customers, products, and regions with poor fulfillment  
- Analyze trends and bottlenecks affecting service reliability  
- Provide actionable insights for operational improvement  

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **SQL** – Data cleaning, transformation, KPI calculation  
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard and data visualization  
- **Excel / CSV** – Source data  

## 📊 Key Metrics
- On-Time Delivery % (OT)  
- In-Full Delivery % (IF)  
- OTIF %  
- Line Fill Rate
